# Replication package for MSR 2015

We provide here the information necessary to replicate the historical analysis of coinstallability issues in the Debian distribution described in the article
*A historical analysis of Debian package incompatibilities* by 
Maelick Claes, Tom Mens, Roberto Di Cosmo and Jérôme Vouillon.

This information consists of the code and scripts used to retrieve and analyse the historical information from the [snapshot.debian.net](http://snapshot.debian.net) archive.


The instruction provided here are intended for execution on a *nix system, especially a GNU/Linux based one, and preferentially a Debian based one, where the prerequisite tools are pre-packaged.

## Prerequisites

Install or compile [the *coinst* tool](https://github.com/vouillon/coinst), which is [described elsewhere](http://coinst.irill.org). On a debian system, just issue the command

```bash
apt-get install coinst
```

## Step 1: retrieve the historical data, and run `coinst`

The `bash` script [process.sh](process.sh) downloads all the needed historical data from the [snapshot.debian.net](http://snapshot.debian.net) archive, and runs the `coinst` tool on each data point.

## Step 2: build the time series

## Step 3: perform the statistical analysis
